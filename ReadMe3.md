What is Static Key, Final
	Static Keyword:

	* Static keyword is used to do better memory management.
	* You can use static keyword with variable, method, class.
	* If you declare method using static keyword then you don't need to create an object to call that method.
	* If you declare variable as a static then only once memory is created for that variable in class area and not every time when object is created. e.g. in student database you can declare "collage name" as because it common for all students.

	Final Keyword:

	* Final Keyword is used to restrict the user. It means:
	* If you declare variable as Final then you cannot change its value.
	* If you declare method as Final then you cannot override that method.
	* If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.
OPPs
Abstract, Interface, traits
	Abstract Class and methods
	Abstract method

	1 Abstract method that is declared but not defined. Only method signature no body. 
	2 Declared using the abstract keyword
	3 These cannot be abstract
	    Constructors
	    Static methods
	    Private methods
	    Methods that are declared “final”

	Abstract Class

	An abstract class outlines the methods but not necessarily implements all the methods.

	1 Abstract class cannot be instantiated which means you cannot create the object of abstract class. 
	To use this class, you need to create another class that extends this abstract class provides 
	the implementation of abstract methods, then you can use the object of that child class 
	to call non-abstract parent class methods as well as implemented methods(those that were abstract in parent
	but implemented in child class).

	2 If a child does not implement all the abstract methods of parent class(the abstract class), 
	then the child class must need to be declared abstract.
	
	Interface
	An interface is a blueprint of a class, which can be declared by using interface keyword. 
	Interfaces can contain only constants and abstract methods (methods with only signatures no body).
	Like abstract classes, Interfaces cannot be instantiated, they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
	Interface is a common way to achieve full abstraction
	
	Traits are a mechanism that provides some of the reuse advantages of multiple inheritance in languages like PHP where multiple inheritance is not 		supported. Traits enable developers to reuse combinations of methods from different class hierarchies.
	Use keyword to use Traits

Difference btwn Encryption and Hashing
Encryption is a two-way function; what is encrypted can be decrypted with the proper key. 
Hashing, however, is a one-way function that scrambles plain text to produce a unique message digest. With a properly designed algorithm, there is no way to reverse the hashing process to reveal the original password
